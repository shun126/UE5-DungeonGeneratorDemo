# ðŸ‘¾ Endless Adventures, Instantly Generated
Bring your roguelike and hack-and-slash games to life with next-level dungeon generation.
Whether youâ€™re aiming for fast-paced, loot-filled battles or deep exploration with infinite replayability,
this Unreal Engine plugin gives you the power to craft unique dungeons every time.

With just a few parametersâ€”such as grid scale, number of rooms, and your own generation rulesâ€”you can instantly produce fully playable layouts. The system works seamlessly both in-editor and at runtime, and is available in both C++ and Blueprint, giving you the flexibility to integrate it into any workflow.

## Visualization of dungeon generation status
The dungeon generator was based on Vazgriz's algorithm. You can read more about [Vazgriz's algorithm here](https://vazgriz.com/119/procedurally-generated-dungeons/).

To vazgriz,
The foundational generation algorithm you shared was a major source of inspiration and became the starting point for my development of the DungeonGenerator plugin. Without your ideas, I don't think I would have arrived at its current form. I'm truly grateful for the knowledge you made available and the impact it had on my work.
